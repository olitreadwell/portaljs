## Workspace and building packages

This monorepo uses npm workspaces (see the `workspaces` field in the root `package.json`). Each publishable package lives under `packages/*` and defines its own `build`/`prepare` scripts:

- `packages/components` and `packages/ckan` build with `tsc && vite build`.
- `packages/ckan-api-client-js` and `packages/core` build with Rollup (`rollup -c`).

To install all dependencies (and build every package via their `prepare` scripts):

```sh
npm install
```

To build a single package:

```sh
npm run build --workspace=packages/<package-name>
# e.g. npm run build --workspace=packages/core
```

Each package's `prepare` script runs its build, so packages are built automatically on `npm install` and on publish.

### Linting and formatting

This repository uses eslint for code linting and prettier for code formatting. There is a base `.eslintrc.json` file in the root that defines global eslint configs; each package can have its own `.eslintrc.json` for package-specific configuration.

## Changesets and publishing packages

> This monorepo is set up with changesets versioning tool. See their [github repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to learn more.

### What are Changesets?

Changesets are files that describe the intention of a contributor to bump a version of the package according to their changes. Changeset file holds two key bits of information: a version type (following semver), and change information to be added to a changelog.

### Adding changesets

In the root directory of the repo, run:

```
npx changeset
```

Select the package that has been changed, the semver version that should be bumped with it and a description of your changes. Please make sure to add the most accurate but also concise information.

To learn about semantic versioning standards see [this semver doc page](https://semver.org/).
